Coding for polymer storage

"In the 1960s, Richard Feynman put forward the idea of using macromolecules such as DNA and polymer for ultra-dense data storage. This idea has attracted renewed attention in the recent years due to the surge of big data.

One of the challenges for making macromolecule storage practical is the problem of low reconstruction rate. Take DNA storage as an example. Suppose some binary data were encoded into a DNA strand (namely, the binary data of 0s and 1s are encoded to a string of the four nucleobases) and one would like to decode the binary data from the DNA. Due to the limitations of DNA sequencing technologies, only fragments of the DNA strand can be read, and this reading process is prone to errors. How would one combine these erroneous pieces to recover the information stored in the DNA?

The goal of this project is to investigate how coding can be utilized to improve the reconstruction rate of polymer storage."
